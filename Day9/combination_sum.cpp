Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where
the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.

//ask interviewer
will the combination unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.
he will say yes

Time Complexity: O(2^t * k) where t is the target, k is the average length

Reason: Assume if you were not allowed to pick a single element multiple times, every element will have a couple of options: pick or 
not pick which is 2^n different recursion calls, also assuming that the average length of every combination generated is k. (to put 
length k data structure into another data structure)

Why not (2^n) but (2^t) (where n is the size of an array)?

Assume that there is 1 and the target you want to reach is 10 so 10 times you can “pick or not pick” an element.

Space Complexity: O(k*x), k is the average length and x is the no. of combinations
